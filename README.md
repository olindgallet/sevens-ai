Game Description here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevens_%28card_game%29

The strategy is to get rid of the highest and lowest card in hand if possible. If not, then remove the next highest and lowest card if possible.
The program works by reading the game state from input.txt, thinking about the best move, then outputting its choice in move.txt.

Check out SevenCardsGame, the main program, for more information.
